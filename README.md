<script type="text/javascript">
    lightningChatApiBase = "<your api access point>";
    lightningChatInterfaceResources = {
        htmlPath:"<path to ui.html>",
        welcomeMessage: "Welcome to AMACSS at UTSC, how can we help?",

### How to use

All interations are done by sending private messages to the bot.

For example, if you type `help`:

The little check mark under your message means the bot has recieved you message.


If a visitor sends a message, there **WON'T** be any notifications. You can modify this behavior by modifying the source code.

You can type `list` or `listall` to see all sessions.

If you wish to recieve all notifications for a session, you must be assigned. Type `assign {session id} {your username}` to assign yourself. Only one person can be assigned for each session.

Now, if the visitor sends a message, you will get notification for it.

You can reply by typing `reply {session id} {your message}`.

The little OK icon under your message indicates your message has been sent.

You can also get a chat history, just type `history {session id}`.

Once you are done, type `close {session id}` to close a chat session.
